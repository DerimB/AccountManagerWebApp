# Account Manager Website Application

## Overview
This project builds upon the foundation of a password management database which I created previously. The goal is to enhance the system by implementing features that make it more robust and user-friendly. This was done by adding PHP, HTML, and CSS to create a website application to put the database to use.

## Features
- **Relation Separation**: Content in flat relations is separated into distinct relations.
- **Relationships**: Establishes relationships between the separated relations.
- **Key Constraints**: Adds key constraints to enhance data integrity.
- **ER Model**: Visualizes relationships using the Entity-Relationship (ER) model.
- **Interactive Layer**: Integrates HTML forms and PHP to create an interactive user interface.

## Functionality
The password management system, implemented as an MVC-based application, allows users to:
- **Search** and display entries in a user-friendly table format.
- **Update** columns/attributes using distinct pattern matching.
- **Insert** new entries with details such as site/app name, URL, email address, username, password, and a comment.
- **Delete** entries based on specified patterns.
- **Refresh** the page with a prominently placed button.
